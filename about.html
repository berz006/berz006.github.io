                            Barbara has been commissioned by Colonial Williamsburg to paint pieces sold in the foundation's shops. Her passion for Williamsburg enables her to add much love in her work for the colonial capitol of Virginia. Barbara demonstrates "country tin painting" at the St. George Tucker House in Colonial Williamsburg when she visits each December where she has met some very interesting people from around the world.
